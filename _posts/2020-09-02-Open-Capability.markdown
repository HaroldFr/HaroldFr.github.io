Some art forms are a combination of other art forms. Movies have stories, music, and all sorts of visual arts. Novels are limited to only the words on the page. They can’t draw from movies or music. Paintings can draw subjects from books. Sculptures can likewise find their subjects from stories but not music. Video games take cinematic elements from movies, have musical scores, and even imitate architecture. It can be said that some art forms have more open capability compared to other art forms. This is the capability to reproduce an element from one medium into another. An example of this is how narrative can be adopted across different art forms. Narrative can be found across mediums as different as sculpture and music. Books cannot reproduce the immersive narrative form of video games, but video games can adopt a third or first person perspective of narration. Unlike other art forms, video games can also be open to disciplines outside of art by applying its technology to other disciplines. 

A panel at MIT about video games discussed the way video game technology can be used in nano technology research. It is a marker of the time that the discourse on video games has drastically changed. Partly this is how video game technology has been useful in medicine and education. Social media is actually a form of video game because of gamification and the creation of novelty. Virtual reality can be used to interact with things at the nano level to see things that are too small. Being able to see things that are too small and fragile to handle is useful in fields like medicine and physics, where researchers can use a simulation rather than live subjects. For instance, though it sounds like science fiction, and it probably is, A. I. can be trained to defeat diseases. This is interesting particularly with cognitive diseases such as Alzheimer’s where it is questionable whether things like intelligence and personality deteriorate. 

Another topic that was touched on during the discussion was how video game technology changed social media. Both video games and social media allow people to communicate with different aspects of themselves. It has been my impression that the cause of misinformation on the internet is due to the use of artificial selves. When communicating through the internet, visual and behavior cues are lost, which allows us to detect sincerity. It’s a different story at the level of data, but online it is hard to detect these cues. It is interesting to think about free speech in the context of the analogy between video games and social media. If social media was a video game, and the creators made everything from the rules to the characters, then how much of it is actually influenced by the players? Is what I create in this context predetermined? 

I write science fiction, so what came to my mind was the possibility of a disease like Alzheimer’s eroding personality and intelligence, an artificial self will be preserved to adopt the body. I suppose not enough attention has been given to ideas like artificial selves and its effect on how we communicate and how it drives technological progress. Different ways of tackling cognitive diseases needs to be considered to find holistic ways our bodies and minds can ward off over reliance on technology. 

Recovery from neurodegenerative diseases has been sort of like the fountain of youth to pharmaceutical companies for a long time and there's still no drug that can replicate how the mind recovers on its own. This capacity to recover degrades with age. Maybe this is a job for artificial intelligence technology?
