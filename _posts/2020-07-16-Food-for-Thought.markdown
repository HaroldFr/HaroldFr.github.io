I was at the yard. It was so hot I wanted to go back inside and eat. I think he forgot to feed me. I best remind him to feed me by staring at my bowl for an indifinite amount of time. First, I need to get back inside. The heat is starting to make me thoughtful. Sometimes I wonder if I was person in a previous life. Like those plants whose life are absorbed by the soil and returns to the surface as weeds. This thought made my stomach growl.
