When writing short stories, I create character bios to give the story meaning and depth. I don’t include the entire bio to the narrative. They serve more as an undercurrent to the narrative. This is similar to the whole iceberg metaphor. I thought I could do the same for characters in movies, books, and maybe even video games. I don’t focus on fictive details, but rather I ask myself what motivates the character, how has the character changed in the narrative, and why the character is effective. I decided to write a character study of Ari from the movie “Head On” because that was one of the last films I saw on Netflix. He’s a compelling countercultural character with overlaying complexities of culture, sexuality, and gender. 

His character has a philosophical turn in that he is driven by achieving certainty. It seems that he is driven by pleasure because the scenes takes him from one party to another where he hooks up, does drugs, and dances. In the midst of this, he encounters confrontations that expects him to take the role of a traditional man. This role comes from his Greek Orthodox upbringing. At the end of the film, he rejoices in achieving the certainty that his journey has fulfilled with the following monologue:  

“I'm a whore, a dog, and a cunt. My father's insults make me strong. I accept them all. I'm sliding toward the sewer. I'm not struggling. I can smell the shit but I'm still breathing. I'm gonna live my life. I'm not gonna make a difference. I'm not gonna change a thing. No one's gonna remember me when I'm dead. I'm a sailor and a whore, and I will be until the end of the world.”   

Certainty is marked by “no longer struggling” and the finality of “until the end of the world.” The universality of stench is, for the protagonist, something to celebrate. It is the ultimate realization of one’s place in the world. The tangibility of pleasure takes him to certainty. 

The setting for his quest is modern day Greece. His sexuality attempts to transcend the pressure of varying roles imposed on him by friends and relatives. It is also imposed on him by the stigma of same sex love. This creates uncertainty of fate. As long as his desires only manifest itself as sex, then his act does not define his identity. This seems to transcend the pressure that comes with coming of age. However, the consequences for gay men reveal itself when he gets arrested with his transgender friend. At this point in the narrative, he is again forced to decide whether he wants to take on a role or transcend towards certainty through pleasure. 

The protagonist is a young man brought up in a Greek household with orthodox values. His heritage provides him with various roles such as being the dutiful son and the role model in his family. He denies these to achieve the certainty that tangible pleasure provides. Ari rarely talks in the film and lacks any grounded beliefs. He is at a stage of life where he is pressured to take on a certain role to inherit societal support. His motive, though not obvious, remains consistent throughout the film. We learn early on that he accepts the certainty of pleasure and the transcendent quality of his sexuality, but only at the end of the film do we realize that it is certainty that gives him the most satisfaction. 

I found this character to be provocative and reflective of the decisions that gay men must make early on in life. Paul Capsis, who plays Johnny/Toula in the movie, relates to Ari in a similar way when he says in an interview, 

"I understood the world was hostile – Australian men, Greek men … the Greeks I grew up with were from the religious viewpoint that it was 'unnatural'. I heard a lot of 'just keep it to yourself', 'just marry a girl and then do what you want."

It is interesting that the protagonist does not identify himself sexually even though he defends his transgender friend. Ari's transition from one party to the next while confronting culture and society with his sexuality and behavior is exhausting. It almost seems that his quest is self-destructive. The character is based on the author of the book that inspired the movie, Christos Tsiolkas. I have not read the book, "Loaded", so I can only assume that the film is different. This movie is different from other gay films and yet it addresses the same issues found in other coming of age narrative about same sex love. Mainly, the realization of same sex attraction changes the path one takes in life and the question must be answered alone.
