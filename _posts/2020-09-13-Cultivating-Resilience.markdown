Current resources on resilience offer three main ways to restore resilience. These are food, sleep, and exercise. If the food is healthy, the sleep adequate, and exercise regular, then the person can maintain general health and well-being. These requirements are not only simple, but they are evident. However, these three ways to build up resilience are much more harder to acquire by practice. 

In practice, they require to be done in a correct way. This has made the correct way for exercise, sleep, and food a problem in itself. One reason why the correct way to do things has become a problem is the itch for certainty and convenient solutions. Because of the craving for certainty and convenience, building up resilience has been mixed up for resilience itself. 

If an individual sleeps well, exercise regularly, and eats nutritious food, it’s because they're already healthy. That’s the same as saying that in order for me to be healthy, I have to be healthy. If it sounds inadequate to say that all you need to do to be healthy is eat nutritious food, sleep enough, and exercise every other day, it is because they do not address the things that prevent well-being. 

Obstacles that prevent health and well-being are specific to each individual. Such general advice is widely agreed on because they scratch the itch for certainty and convenience. As an example to how these are traits of health, if I get a fever, I lose my appetite, gain fatigue, and get sleep disturbances. Being able to do otherwise is a marker of health. My reader would counter, “Maybe a person chooses to be sedentary? Would that person increase their resilience by working out?” 
I admit. I play video games all the time. I could do so for hours. But maybe the sedentary fellow didn’t need to be resilient. 

For resilience to exhibit itself, it has to be tested. If a person is healthy, but lacks challenges in life, wouldn’t it be easy to mistake standard health for resilience? Resilience is characterized by challenges, not overall health and well-being. Each individual experience challenges in a different way even though many groups are afflicted by certain obstacles. 

One of my favorite story that continues to guide my view of resilience is about a mountaineer who fell and broke his leg at high part of a mountain. He had a climbing partner, but because he broke his leg, his climbing partner had to support him. A life and death decision left Joe Simpson alone on the mountain with a broken leg. He resorted to his resilience to make his way back down the mountain. His experiences were unique to him, but there are many stories such as this about mountaineers. 

While his story doesn’t directly apply to me, this story has taught me the quality of striving for life. *The Economist* called his book “a moving fable about human resilience.” This quality of striving for life shows the stuff of humanity. That’s why they called it *human* resilience. Stories about resilience contribute to the cultivation of what makes us human. This notion of humanity is actually interesting. Some think of humanity as associated with education, status, and culture. Others, such as myself, sees it as life reduced to a primordial state of being. This last sort of humanity is important because it allows us to value things that are natural. Without valuing things that are natural, we can't appreciate things that sustain life. 

Very little of Mr. Simpson’s story applies to me. I am not a mountaineer. I’m a gay man who is afraid of heights and plays video games too much. But I appreciated this story of resilience because it described a specific ordeal. It’s not even a book about resilience. It just shows it. One of the reason why it is hard for me to accept prescriptions is that my challenges are unique to me as an ethnic and sexual minority. In fact, I have heard very little stories that demonstrates resilience that are certain to my group. 

The lack of representative stories of resilience means that we do not give the appreciation these stories deserve. I recently heard that 25 transgender folks died this year. Maybe if we appreciate their stories of resilience, we don’t have to wait until they become another statistic. Perhaps what is difficult in telling these stories is that it’s hard to determine the ending. Joe Simpson was able to tell his story only after he survived. While hate crime is a continuous condition afflicting an entire group. To make matters worst, even though hate crimes have become prevalent, institutions that are supposed to help them are doing the opposite.
  
I credit Joe Simpson’s book, “Touching the Void,” for helping me appreciate stories of resilience. I hope this article has shown that there is no right or wrong way of being resilient. One simply has to make it to the otherside and be able to bear witness, so that others can bear witness with them. I have another book that has helped me cultivate resilience, which I’ll reserve for my next article.
