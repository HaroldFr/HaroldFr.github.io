I am studying programming languages and have a certificate in Python, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Currently, I am a technical writer. In the past, I studied both ancient and modern languages. Sometimes, I write poetry and short stories. I enjoy writing about books or articles that I've found insightful. My interests range from data science to ancient history. I play video games for fun. I have a dog named Fimoni. If you found this page from LinkedIn, contact me there for my resume.
